Do you want to know what are the chances of your flight getting delayed?
Do you want to know what are the chances of your flight getting delayed?

I have created a Tableau dashboard for the same.

I added filters to filter the data by Carrier, Origin City, Destination City.

I color coded the Average Arrival Delay so that the user can use the color coded data to find out what he is looking for. 
I made use of bar charts to show the average flight delay in minutes. Bar charts serve a great purpose in comparing the data.
